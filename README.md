# Hi 👋 I'm Eden! 

A passionate Frontend Web Developer in Montreal, QC

- 🔭 I’m currently refining my JavaScript and Sass/Scss knowledge through ongoing projects. 
- 📷 Seven years as a photographer has refined my creative eye, honed my storytelling skills, and instilled a deep understanding of composition, lighting, and emotion in imagery. This experience has also emphasized adaptability and client satisfaction in a dynamic field.
- 🌱 I want to learn Python and TypeScript next!
- ❤️ My energetic, curious, and creative nature fuels my passion for the arts, social justice, technology, and human relationships. I am committed to personal growth and aspire to forge authentic connections with people.
